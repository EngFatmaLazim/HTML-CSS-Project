# HTML-CSS-Project

<h2>This design is from scratch</h2>
Using only HTML & CSS.

<h1>Note: </h1>


  This design is not responsive, If anyone is interested in converting it to that
  I welcome his cooperation.
  
  Every time you refresh the page, You will find that all images change.
  This is because these images are not added as static images in the Images folder.
  I used this site to generate the images: http://lorempixel.com/ .
